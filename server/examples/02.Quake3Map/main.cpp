/** Example 002 Quake3Map

This Tutorial shows how to load a Quake 3 map into the engine, create a
SceneNode for optimizing the speed of rendering, and how to create a user
controlled camera.

Please note that you should know the basics of the engine before starting this
tutorial. Just take a short look at the first tutorial, if you haven't done
this yet: http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/tut001.html

Lets start like the HelloWorld example: We include the irrlicht header files
and an additional file to be able to ask the user for a driver type using the
console.
*/
#include <irrlicht.h>
#include <iostream>

#include "server.h"

/*
As already written in the HelloWorld example, in the Irrlicht Engine everything
can be found in the namespace 'irr'. To get rid of the irr:: in front of the
name of every class, we tell the compiler that we use that namespace from now
on, and we will not have to write that 'irr::'. There are 5 other sub
namespaces 'core', 'scene', 'video', 'io' and 'gui'. Unlike in the HelloWorld
example, we do not call 'using namespace' for these 5 other namespaces, because
in this way you will see what can be found in which namespace. But if you like,
you can also include the namespaces like in the previous example.
*/
using namespace irr;

/*
Again, to be able to use the Irrlicht.DLL file, we need to link with the
Irrlicht.lib. We could set this option in the project settings, but to make it
easy, we use a pragma comment lib:
*/
#ifdef _MSC_VER
#pragma comment(lib, "Irrlicht.lib")
#endif

enum
{
	// I use this ISceneNode ID to indicate a scene node that is
	// not pickable by getSceneNodeAndCollisionPointFromRay()
	ID_IsNotPickable = 0,

	// I use this flag in ISceneNode IDs to indicate that the
	// scene node can be picked by ray selection.
	IDFlag_IsPickable = 1 << 0,
	
	// I use this flag in ISceneNode IDs to indicate that the
	// scene node can be highlighted.  In this example, the
	// homonids can be highlighted, but the level mesh can't.
	IDFlag_IsHighlightable = 1 << 1
};

/* Ok, lets start. Again, we use the main() method as start, not the WinMain(). */

{

	Like in the HelloWorld example, we create an IrrlichtDevice with
	createDevice(). The difference now is that we ask the user to select
	which video driver to use. The Software device might be
	too slow to draw a huge Quake 3 map, but just for the fun of it, we make
	this decision possible, too.
	Instead of copying this whole code into your app, you can simply include

	Now we can load the mesh by calling

	irr::scene::IAnimatedMesh. As you might know, Quake 3 maps are not
	really animated, they are only a huge chunk of static geometry with
	some materials attached. Hence the IAnimatedMesh consists of only one
	frame, so we get the "first frame" of the "animation", which is our
	quake level and create an Octree scene node with it, using
	irr::scene::ISceneManager::addOctreeSceneNode().
	The Octree optimizes the scene a little bit, trying to draw only geometry
	which is currently visible. An alternative to the Octree would be a
	irr::scene::IMeshSceneNode, which would always draw the complete
	geometry of the mesh, without optimization. Try it: Use
	irr::scene::ISceneManager::addMeshSceneNode() instead of
	addOctreeSceneNode() and compare the primitives drawn by the video
	driver. (There is a irr::video::IVideoDriver::getPrimitiveCountDrawn()
	method in the irr::video::IVideoDriver class). Note that this
	optimization with the Octree is only useful when drawing huge meshes
	consisting of lots of geometry.
